Bruh I didn't do any research before creating this just use
[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io)

It's kinda crazy that they did it exactly how I envisioned it, just 10 years before me.

I still have some minor issues with the software but overall can't complain its pretty good.

Maybe one day I will work on a "fork" (not really cause I will rewrite from scratch) using [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/)
